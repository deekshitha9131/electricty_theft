✅ 3. FULL 3-WEEK TIMELINE (Execution Roadmap)
This is not a “do it when you feel like it” plan.
This is a day-by-day, brutal, structured timeline that forces progress.

🗓 WEEK 1 — Data + Features (Foundation Week)
If you mess up this week, your entire project collapses.
No modeling until your data pipeline is clean.

DAY 1 – Setup
Create GitHub repo with the folder structure I gave
Create requirements.txt
Set up virtual environment
Download your smart meter dataset
Basic EDA plan ready
Deliverables: Repo skeleton + data downloaded.

DAY 2 – Raw Data Exploration
Load dataset
Inspect columns
Look for missing values
Check sampling frequency
Check #customers
Visualize 2–3 random customers consumption curves
Deliverables: Notebook 01_exploration.ipynb.

DAY 3 – Data Cleaning
Handle missing timestamps
Remove duplicates
Remove impossible values
Normalize timestamps
Save cleaned dataset in /data/processed/
Deliverables: Working clean_data.py.

DAY 4 – Feature Engineering
Implement the features I already gave you:
time features
rolling mean
rolling std
peak/off-peak ratio
Add at least 5 new ones:
daily energy
load factor
min/max ratio
hour-to-hour deltas
volatility index (std/mean)
Deliverables: Updated feature_engineering.py.

DAY 5 – Visual Checks
Plot random customer curves
Identify normal vs weird patterns
Plot rolling stats
Plot consumption histograms
Deliverables: Plots inside 02_feature_engineering.ipynb.

DAY 6 – (Optional but powerful) Synthetic Theft Generation
Add 3–4 synthetic theft signatures, e.g.:
constant reading (flatline)
sharp dips
bypass-like patterns
This boosts training for unsupervised models.
Deliverables: external/synthetic_theft.csv.

DAY 7 – BUFFER / CLEANUP
Use this day to fix whatever broke.
Trust me, something will break.

🗓 WEEK 2 — Modeling (Your Make-or-Break Week)

DAY 8 – Isolation Forest
Train baseline Isolation Forest
Compute anomaly scores
Visualize score distribution
Deliverables: isolation_forest.py + results.

DAY 9 – Tune Isolation Forest
Play with:
contamination rate
n_estimators
max_samples
Try at least 5 configs.
Deliverables: Updated model + notes.

DAY 10 – LSTM Autoencoder Prep
Transform data into sliding windows
Set sequence length (e.g., 24 hours)
Create train/val splits
Deliverables: Ready numpy arrays for LSTM.

DAY 11 – Train Autoencoder
20–30 epochs
Check training curves
Calculate reconstruction error
Deliverables: Model saved in /models/trained_models/.

DAY 12 – Autoencoder Thresholding
Compute error distribution
Pick threshold via quantiles or reconstruction score curve
Compare with Isolation Forest
Deliverables: threshold_config.json.

DAY 13 – Deep SVDD (Optional but high-value)
If your hardware can handle it:
extract latent features
train SVDD model
If not, skip it — the first two are strong enough.
Deliverables: model + scores.

DAY 14 – Model Comparison Day
Compare:
ROC-AUC
PR-AUC
Top-k anomalies
False positives
Deliverables: 03_modeling.ipynb complete.

🗓 WEEK 3 — Dashboard + Report + Resume Material
This is where the project becomes portfolio-worthy.
Models without a dashboard = weak project.

DAY 15 – Start Streamlit Dashboard
Create:
sidebar
file loader
basic customer selection
Deliverables: skeleton dashboard/app.py.

DAY 16 – Consumption Plot Section
plot time series
add anomaly markers
add hover tooltips
Deliverables: working visual section.

DAY 17 – Anomaly Score Section
load model
compute score
plot timeline
highlight suspicious windows
Deliverables: score visualization panel.

DAY 18 – Explainability Section
Use SHAP (for Isolation Forest) or feature deltas (for Autoencoder).
Deliverables: reason-codes for anomalies.

DAY 19 – Customer Ranking Feature
Rank customers by anomaly score.
Deliverables: table with sortable risk levels.

DAY 20 – Dashboard Polishing
color theme
layout cleanup
titles + descriptions
Deliverables: final Streamlit app.

DAY 21 – Final GitHub Cleanup
README with architecture
demo GIF
results
resume bullet points
push everything
Deliverables: production-quality repo.
